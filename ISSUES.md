# ISSUES

Use this file to list and control issues/tickets/features/to-dos. In two words, project management.

(At this moment, we prefer to use an ISSUES file instead of any specific project management tool.)

Possible values for status: OPEN, COMPLETE, IGNORED, ONGOING.

## ISSUE #0001 OPEN

Improve versioning, with more expansive git branching.
This includes separate branches for each issue in development and a branch
for each numbered version (alternatively, use separate branches for development and for deploying).
Also record numbered versions on RELEASES file.

## ISSUE #0002 OPEN

Maybe move the code files one folder deeper to separate from builds
and project-related files.

## ISSUE #0003 OPEN

Within project code, maybe separate assets and code better, sending code
one folder deeper.

## ISSUE #0004 ONGOING

Deploy a web version so the game can be player in any web-capable device.
Two possibilities: exporting to HTML5 using local Godot,
or using GitHub Pages and a Jekyll xml script someone already created for this purpose.
