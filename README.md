# Shisima

This is a computer program/video-game implementing the board game Shisima.

## Basic Shisima rules:

Each player plays with one color, white or black.
In each move, a player move one of his/her pieces to another (unoccupied)
spot in the board following the given lines (in this implementation,
this is done by clicking/tapping on the arrows).
The player who aligns his/her three pieces wins the game.
